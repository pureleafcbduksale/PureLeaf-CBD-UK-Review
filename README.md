<h3><strong>What Are CBD Capsules?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>CBD capsules represent a convenient and discreet method to ingest cannabidiol. They consist of pre-measured doses of CBD, typically offered in softgel or tablet formats. PureLeaf CBD UK&rsquo;s capsules contain either full-spectrum CBD or CBD isolate, allowing users to choose between experiencing the entourage effect (where multiple cannabinoids and terpenes collaborate to enhance the effects of CBD) or the more isolated impacts of pure CBD. When ingested, the CBD contained in the capsules is absorbed into the bloodstream via the digestive system, resulting in a more gradual onset of effects compared to other CBD forms, such as tinctures or vaporizers. However, the effects generally persist for a more extended period, making CBD capsules an excellent choice for individuals seeking prolonged relief from a variety of health issues.</p>
